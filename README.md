# Relic

## Recover the lost data treasures concealed within published research.

Relic meticulously extracts and reconstructs the underlying datasets, transforming isolated research into interconnected knowledge, enabling researchers to conduct comprehensive meta-studies, expand limited datasets for better population representation, and discover causal insights that transcend individual studies. With rigorous statistical preservation at its core, Relic ensures that all reconstructed and synthesized data maintains its original statistical properties and relationships, delivering expanded datasets that remain faithful to the source material while offering new analytical possibilities. By preserving statistical significance and distribution characteristics, Relic produces data expansions that are not just larger, but genuinely meaningfulâ€”allowing researchers to build upon existing work with complete confidence in the validity of their derived insights.
